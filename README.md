# cybersecurity-task-6

Task Objective
The objective of this task was to understand what constitutes a strong password and to evaluate the strength of several passwords using a free, online password strength checker. The goal was to identify best practices and understand the security implications of different password complexities.

Steps Performed
Password Creation: I created a set of passwords with varying lengths and combinations of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).

Password Evaluation: Each password was tested using an online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com).

Results Documentation: The scores and feedback from the tool were recorded to analyze the factors contributing to password strength.

Research: I conducted research on common password attacks, specifically brute force and dictionary attacks, to understand why password strength is a critical security measure.

Best Practices: Based on the evaluation and research, I identified and summarized key best practices for creating secure passwords.

Password Evaluation Results
Here is a summary of the passwords tested and their results:

Password Tested

password123 :

              Very Weak

              Short, uses a common dictionary word, and sequential numbers. Highly susceptible to dictionary attacks.

Cyber!S3cur1ty_2025 :

                      Very Strong

                      Long length, mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). Highly resistant to both brute force and dictionary attacks.

12345678 :

           Very Weak

          Short, sequential numbers only. Extremely easy to guess with a brute-force attack.

Key Takeaways
Length is Paramount: The longer a password is, the more time and computational power is required to crack it via brute-force.

Character Variety: Including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols dramatically increases the number of possible character combinations, making the password significantly more secure.

Avoid Common Words: Using dictionary words, common phrases, or personal information makes a password vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Passphrases are a good alternative, but they should be long and use unrelated words.

Understanding Attacks: The research on brute-force and dictionary attacks highlighted the importance of these best practices. A strong password is designed to be resilient against these common cracking methods.

Conclusion
This task provided a practical understanding of password security. By creating and testing different passwords, I was able to see firsthand how complexity and length directly correlate with a password's strength and its resistance to common cyber attacks. This reinforces the importance of using unique, long, and complex passwords for all online accounts.
